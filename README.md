This is a c# application to test multiple targets for a project.

The aim is to have Debug, QA, and Release builds to have their own Click-Once target.

## Required Extensions

- [SlowCheetah](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/05bb50e3-c971-4613-9379-acae2cfe6f9e) plugin for Visual Studio is needed (although it is part of a nuget package, I had to download the vsix extension to get the Add Transform to operate).
